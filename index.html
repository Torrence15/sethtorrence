                    I have been programming for a while most of it self taught.
                    Starting with a solid foundation in HTML I moved to CSS, Javascript and,
                    SCSS (Superset of CSS). I really tinkered with JavaScript and discovered that if
                    I used PHP, it would enable forms on my websites.
                    From there I ventured into SQL and MongoDB to store the information of my forms
                    into databases that had specific structuring, based on the working needs of a particular site.
                     Moving on from databases, I then explored standalone application utilizng C, C++, and, Java. 
                    My favorite language has always been JavaSctipt due to its ease of use. 
                    JavaScript enabled me to write bots for my Discord server (Voice over IP client) 
                    which in turn taught me async and waiting for a response.
                    These bots helped me learn async and waiting for response before continuing. 
                    While writing in JavaScript I picked up on Node which introduced me to NPM. 
                    While researching NPM packages I discovered Electron a program that allows you 
                    to build standalone JavaScript programs that can display a canvas or an HTML website. 
                    This brings me to eventually switching to TypeScript for easier and more secure coding.

                        Graduated in 2019 from Newark High School. Took part in the AP Computer Science
                        course and achieved a score of 5 on the exam.

                        In 2018 me and another student helped create the robotics team at Newark High. 
                        We participated in the First Tech Challenge and made it to states in our first year.
                        My role was primarily coding the robot which was in Java. In 2019 we also competed in FTC,
                        and made another run at states but, we couldn't compete with the budgets of the private schools.

                        The fall of 2019 I began majoring in computer science at Delaware Technical Community College. 
                        I am currently only taking Computer Science 1. Delaware Tech focueses on C++ for the course.

                        invaluable to me, and I learned a lot in a very short time. While with Legacy I also helped implement, 
                        and migrate to a new website platform. At the time Legacy was moving to Shopify and my job was to help 
                        make that transition as smooth as possible. This job introduced me to communicating with other locations to 
                        solve problems, as well as working with a team to accomplish one goal.</span>
