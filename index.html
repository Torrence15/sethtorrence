                    I have been programming for a while most of it self taught.
                    Starting with HTML at a young age I excelled and continued
                    into CSS, JavaScript and SCSS (Superset code of CSS). After
                    that I started tinkering with JavaScript more and found that
                    if I used PHP I could enable forms and such on my websites.
                    Then I got into SQL and MongoDB to store the information of my forms
                    into databases that had specific structuring based on the needs of 
                    the site I was working on. Moving on from databases I looked into building
                    standalone applications and that brought me to C, C++ and, Java. 
                    My favorite language has always been JavaSctipt because of its ease of use.
                     Since I had the desire to code JavaScript more so than any other language
                    I started writing bots for my Discord server (Online Voice Over IP client).
                    These bots helped me learn async and waiting for response before continuing.
                     While I was writing JavaScript bots I learned about Electron a program that
                    lets you build standalone applications running on JavaScript these applications
                    can display webpages or a JavaScript canvas. This was around the time I began coding
                    in TypeScript as well this allowed for easier coding and more secure coding.
